# BetterLock

Module Launcher for Good Lock Add-ons from Samsung. 

* Here is a repo with the icon names and some information about each app for use by my client android app by the name of BetterLock.  
* The application pulls the json into it's app and then parses the text and loads the icons. 
* This repo contains JSON that refers to each individual module by it's package name, version, icon link, app title, and description/summary from what appears in good lock

## Goal

* GoodLock and it's add-ons are all blocked except for the United States, Canada, and several other countries. 
* The goal of my project is to make a client version similar to the core functionality of Good Lock but with additional features. 

## Usage

* You are welcome to use the JSON for your own project/client
